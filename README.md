## ⚙️ Development commands

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `/docs` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
